# Use Ruby to make slides for your next presentation.

Creating a presentation doesn't have to involve
[Powerpoint][powerpoint] or [Keynote][keynote].

With the [reveal-ck gem][reveal-ck-gem], you author slides in
[haml][haml], [slim][slim], or even [ruby][ruby] itself.

Because [you're just working with text][it-is-just-text], you maintain
the benefits of text-based simplicity.

When it is time to present, the gem provides a command line executable
that generates static html in the form of a [reveal.js][reveal.js]
presentation.

[reveal.js][reveal.js] won't let you down. It looks good, works on
phones and tablets, supports speaker notes, themes, various transition
styles, effects, and syntax highlighting.

# Why?

reveal-ck was created so that any rubyist could quickly create
slides.

Write in plain text. Scan content quickly. Track slides the way you
track code. Use standard Ruby tools to leverage a robust HTML5
presentation framework.

You matter, your presentation matters, your message matters. reveal-ck
helps you focus on your content.

If that sounds good, then [let's get started][getting-started].
