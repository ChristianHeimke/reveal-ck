# reveal-ck

With the [reveal-ck gem][reveal-ck-gem], you author slides in
[haml][haml], [slim][slim], or even [ruby][ruby] itself.

You get to stay focused on a single, [text-based][it-is-just-text]
file. Creating a presentation doesn't have to involve
[Powerpoint][powerpoint] or [Keynote][keynote]. Use your favorite
editor. Use popular templating languages. Use conventions and tools
that you already know.

The gem provides a command line program that generates static html in
the form of a [reveal.js][reveal.js] presentation.

Your presentation looks good, works on phones and tablets, supports
speaker notes, themes, transition styles, effects, and syntax
highlighting.

With reveal-ck, you leverage the power of [reveal.js][reveal.js] while
focusing on your content and using a ruby toolset.

# Why?

reveal-ck was created so that any rubyist could quickly create
slides.

Write in plain text. Scan content quickly. Track slides the way you
track code. Use standard Ruby tools.

You matter, your presentation matters, your message matters. reveal-ck
helps you focus on your content.
