<p class="lead">
With the <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/reveal-ck">reveal-ck
gem</a>, you author slides in <a href="./markdown">markdown</a>, <a
href="./haml">haml</a>, <a href="./slim">slim</a>, or even <a
href="./ruby">ruby</a> itself.
</p>

You get to stay focused on a single, [text-based][it-is-just-text]
file. Creating a presentation doesn't have to involve
[Powerpoint][powerpoint] or [Keynote][keynote]. Use your favorite
editor. Use popular templating languages. Use conventions and tools
that you already know.

The gem provides a command line program that generates static html in
the form of a [reveal.js][reveal.js] presentation.

Your presentation looks good, works on phones and tablets, supports
speaker notes, themes, transition styles, effects, and syntax
highlighting.

With reveal-ck, you leverage the power of [reveal.js][reveal.js] while
focusing on your content and using a ruby toolset.

# Why?

<p class="lead">
reveal-ck was created so that any rubyist could quickly create slides.
</p>


Write in plain text. Scan content quickly. Track slides the way you
track code. Use standard Ruby tools.

You matter, your presentation matters, your message matters. reveal-ck
helps you focus on your content.
