## Creating Slides with Slim

Regardless of which template language you are working in, each slide
is based on a `<section/>`.

Here is a simple example:

```haml
section
  h1 Hello World
  h3 ..in Slim
```

### Resources

I went through each of the slides in reveal.js and converted to an
[equivalent version in slim][reveal-ck-template-slides-slim], and I
hope you find it useful.

The main references I use are:

* [The main Slim site][slim]
* [The Slim reference][slim-reference]
