## Creating Slides with Haml

Regardless of which template language you are working in, each slide
is based on a `<section/>`.

Here is a simple example:

```haml
section
  %h1
    Hello World
  %h3
    ..in Haml
```

### Resources

I use the following whenever I get involved with HAML:

* [The main Haml site][haml]
* [The Haml reference][haml-reference]
