# It's just text

Creating a presentation, traditionally, means using a tool like
Powerpoint or Keynote. You'd probably manually create backups. It
would probably be hard to tell exactly what changed from day-to-day.

## There's no context switch

If you're using something like reveal-ck, there's no new tool, no
context switch.

Continue using whatever editor you feel most comfortable with. Track
your progress with git, and you'll get meaningful differences over
time for free. Keep images in an `images/` directory and code samples
in a `code/` directory.

Further, when you generate the end result, it is just static
html. It's easily [hosted] and will be accessible in any modern
browser. You don't need to get something like "Powerpoint Reader for
iPad," you can just use the browser that's already there.
