              This is a high level description of how reveal-ck
              creates a presentation. Greater detail is available in
              the

            <h2>Making Slides</h2>
            <p>
              Slide generation centers around running the command
              <code>reveal-ck generate</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <code>generate</code> process takes a file
              containing your slides and creates a presentation in a
              new directory named <code>slides</code>.
            </p>
            <h2>What happens during this process?</h2>
            <p>
              Everything starts with your <em>slides file</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you author slide content in Markdown, your <em>slides
              file</em> will be named <code>slides.md</code>. If you
              write in html it's <code>slides.html</code>. If you
              write in erb it will
              be <code>slides.html.erb</code>. The same pattern holds
              true for <code>slides.haml</code>, <code>slides.textile</code>,
              <code>slides.slim</code>, and <code>slides.rb</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Regardless of authoring technology, you put your slide
              content into the <em>slides files</em> and
              run <code>reveal-ck generate</code>.
            </p>
            <h2>And then what happens?</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>
                The file <code>config.yml</code> is scanned, if it
                exists. Values within inform the generation process.
              </li>
              <li>
                The reveal-ck gem contains a recent copy of reveal.js
                within it. This copy is unpacked into
                the <code>slides/</code> directory.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you have supporting files in directories
                named <code>images/</code>,
                <code>css/</code>, <code>js/</code>,
                or <code>media/</code>, these files are copied into
                the <code>slides/</code> directory.
              </li>
              <li>
                Your <em>slides file</em> is transformed into html and
                stored at <code>slides/slides.html</code>.
              </li>
              <li>
                Pieces of a reveal.js's <code>index.html</code> (which
                serves as the demo) are also stored within the
                reveal-ck gem. These pieces are merged together with
                the content in <code>slides/slides.html</code>. The
                result is a stored at <code>slides/index.html</code>.
              </li>
              <li>
                The body of <code>slides/index.html</code> is run
                through a series of filters. These filters provide
                support for

            <h2>The Slides File</h2>
            <p>
              Your slide content lives in a single file known as
              the <em>slides file</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can supply configuration and styling. You can have
              distinct images and audio files. You can even include
              text from other files, but everything revolves around
              the <em>slides file</em>. It is the core of your
              content.

            <h2>Supporting Files</h2>
            <p>
              reveal-ck <em>allows</em> you to reduce a presentation
              to a single file, but what if you want to include
              images? CSS? mp3s? reveal-ck expects that supporting
              files are placed into directories.
            </p>
            <p>
              Any images included in the <code>images</code> directory
              will be copied into the presentation. This mean they can
              be referenced relatively: <code>&lt;img
              src="image/foo.png"/&gt;</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you include a CSS file in the <code>css</code>
              directory, it will be automatically included in the
              generated presentation and linked into
              the <code>&lt;head/&gt;</code> of the final index.html.
            </p>
            <p>
              Files in the <code>media</code> directory will be copied
              into the presentation. For example, mp3s can be
              referenced by <code>&lt;audio/&gt;</code> tags.
            </p>
            <p>
              Files in the <code>templates</code> directory aren't
              copied into the presentation, but, they can be
              referenced via the <code>slide</code> DSL method when
              working with a <code>slides.rb</code>.

            <h2>Filters</h2>
            <p>
              The last step in the creation of your presentation
              involves running filters over your the html content in
              your presentation.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <a href="https://github.com/jch/html-pipeline">html-pipeline</a>
              framework is used to support filtering. :emoji: is
              replaced, links are auto-linked, and @mentions are
              transformed into github user URLs. Some of these filters
              are configurable.

            <h2>Web Server</h2>
            <p>
              You can show your slides by opening the generated
              index.html in a browser. However, presentation mode will
              not work unless they are served up via http.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can type <code>reveal-ck serve</code> and an http
              server will startup on port 10000 serving up the content
              of your slides directory.
